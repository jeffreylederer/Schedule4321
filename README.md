Lawn Bowling 4321 Scheduler

This will create a printed schedule for a 4321 Lawn Bowling tournament so the tournament directory can create the individual scorecards.

In theory this should work with any tournament with 9 to 30 players. It does not allow any player to play any other player more than once.

When there are the number of players is not evenly divisible by 3, the program creates one or four games with two players.

The only issue is the PROGRAM CANNOT complete. It uses permutations to create different possible player orders.
